This can cause problems if you want to work with people on other platforms.

To be portable it is advisable to rename the file.

If you know what you are doing you can disable this check using:

  git config hooks.allownonascii true
EOF
	exit 1
fi

branch=`git symbolic-ref HEAD --short`
if [ ${branch} = master ]; then
	cat <<\EOF
	エラー：masterブランチにcommitはできません。
EOF
	exit 1
fi

# If there are whitespace errors, print the offending file names and fail.
exec git diff-index --check --cached $against --
